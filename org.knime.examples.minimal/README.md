### How to use the templates in this plugin to create a new KNIME node
This plugin contains minimalistic KNIME nodes with Web UI dialogs that can be used as templates when creating new nodes. For creating a new node based on one of these templates, follow these steps:

1. Determine whether the logic of the node you are planning to implement can be expressed via a [ColumnRearranger](https://bitbucket.org/KNIME/knime-core/src/master/org.knime.core/src/eclipse/org/knime/core/data/container/ColumnRearranger.java). This is generally the case if the node merely re-orders / adds / removes columns to / from the input table but does not change the number of rows. If so, use the MinimalWebUISimpleStreamableNodeFactory as template, otherwise, go with the MinimalWebUINodeFactory.
2. Create copies of the applicable minimal factory and model classes as well as the settings class. Give the copies fitting names, such as MyNodeFactory, MyNodeModel, and MyNodeSettings. In the model class, update the references to the settings class; in the factory class, update the references to the model and settings classes. Place the files in their own package in the src folder of the plugin you'd like the node to be a part of.
3. Register the new node factory in the plugin.xml of the plugin to which the code was copied, e.g., org.knime.examples.minimal/plugin.xml.
4. Update the node factory class with a fitting name for the node, as well as descriptions, an icon, etc. Once you have done so, launch KNIME Analytics Platform and make sure you find the node in the node search.
5. Update the node settings class with any settings that you would like your node to be configurable with. Provide settings with [@Widget](https://bitbucket.org/KNIME/knime-core-ui/src/master/org.knime.core.ui/src/eclipse/org/knime/core/webui/node/dialog/defaultdialog/widget/Widget.java), or similar, more specialized, annotations to have them contribute to the node's configuration dialog. See the Javadoc of [DefaultNodeSettings](https://bitbucket.org/KNIME/knime-core-ui/src/master/org.knime.core.ui/src/eclipse/org/knime/core/webui/node/dialog/defaultdialog/DefaultNodeSettings.java) for a detailed description of which kinds of settings are allowed and how they can be controlled through annotations.
6. Finally, update the node model with its logic that defines how the node processes its input data and how it creates its output data.
